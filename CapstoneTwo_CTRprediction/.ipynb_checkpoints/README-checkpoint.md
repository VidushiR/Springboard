# Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction Project

Online advertising is one of the largest revenue streams for many companies. Accurately predicting whether a user will click on an ad is critical for optimizing ad placement, improving customer experience, and maximizing revenue. In this project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict click-through rates based on user, ad, and contextual features.

## 1. Data

The dataset simulates real-world ad interaction data, containing millions of ad impressions with click outcomes. It includes features such as:

- User demographics
- Ad features (campaign, ad ID, creative ID, etc.)
- Device information (device type, platform)
- Contextual features (hour, site, app, etc.)

The dataset was obtained from a Kaggle CTR prediction competition.
### Data Sources:

- [Kaggle Dataset (Example Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Project Data Dictionary (optional link if you build one)]

## 2. Methodology

The project follows a full end-to-end machine learning pipeline:

### Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Scaled numerical features where applicable
- Addressed data imbalance with techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or class weights

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Investigated click distribution and feature correlations
- Visualized relationships between categorical features and CTR
- Identified key features such as time of day, device type, and ad ID clusters

### Feature Engineering

- Extracted new features from timestamps (hour of day, day of week)
- Grouped ad features (ad ID frequency, campaign-level grouping)
- Created interaction features

## 3. Modeling & Machine Learning

I tested multiple machine learning models to predict click-through probability:

- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Neural Networks (optional)

### Evaluation Metrics:

Since this is a binary classification problem, I used:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Log Loss

## 4. Model Selection

The best-performing model was **XGBoost Classifier** with optimized hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.

- XGBoost handled large feature space and imbalance better than simpler models.
- ROC-AUC: ~0.80 (example value)
- Log Loss: ~0.40 (example value)

## 5. Cold Start & Business Considerations

CTR prediction models face challenges like:

- Cold start (new ads, new users)
- Data imbalance (far more impressions than clicks)
- High importance of minimizing false positives to avoid wasting ad spend

For production deployment, models would need real-time retraining, online learning capabilities, and further explainability modules.

## 6. Future Improvements

- Incorporate time-decay features to capture user recency behavior
- Deploy model with real-time inference API
- Build monitoring dashboards for ongoing model performance
- Use deep learning models for capturing high-dimensional interactions

---

## 7. Example Prediction Flow

- Input: User + Ad + Context
- Model outputs: CTR probability (e.g. 0.067)
- Business logic decides whether to serve ad based on predicted CTR
