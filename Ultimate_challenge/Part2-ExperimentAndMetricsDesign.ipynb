    "- The goal of the experiment is to get drivers to work in **both cities**, not just one.\n",
    "- This metric shows if drivers are actually **crossing the toll bridge** and doing trips in **both places**.\n",
    "- It’s simple to measure: For each driver, check if they had trips in both cities within a week.\n",
    "- It helps us compare behavior between the **group that gets toll reimbursement** and the **group that doesn’t**.\n",

    "We propose a **randomized controlled trial**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target population:** Driver partners who operate near the toll bridge.\n",
    "- **Control group:** Receives **no toll reimbursement** (business as usual).\n",
    "- **Treatment group:** Receives **toll reimbursement** for any cross-city trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental period:**  \n",
    "4 to 6 weeks, covering both weekdays and weekends to capture usage patterns across different days.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data to collect:**\n",
    "- Driver ID\n",
    "- City of each trip (Gotham or Metropolis)\n",
    "- Date and time of trip\n",
    "- Whether the toll bridge was crossed\n",
    "- Reimbursement status\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effect of toll reimbursement on cross-city activity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary test:**  \n",
    "  **Two-proportion z-test** or **Chi-square test**  \n",
    "  > To compare the percentage of cross-city drivers in the treatment vs control group.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optional (if using continuous data):**  \n",
    "  **t-test** or **Mann-Whitney U test**  \n",
    "  > To compare the number of cross-city trips per driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:**\n",
    "- **H₀ (null):** Toll reimbursement has no effect on driver cross-city activity.\n",
    "- **H₁ (alt):** Toll reimbursement increases cross-city activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Interpretation and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the treatment group shows a statistically significant increase in cross-city service:**\n",
    "- Conclude that toll reimbursement **successfully encourages** broader driver coverage.\n",
    "- Recommend **scaling the program** if cost-effective.\n",
    "- Consider expanding incentives based on regional behavior patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveats:**\n",
    "- Ensure **random assignment** is unbiased.\n",
    "- Monitor for **external factors** (weather, fuel prices, city events).\n",
    "- Prevent **reimbursement abuse** (e.g., unnecessary bridge crossings for compensation).\n",
